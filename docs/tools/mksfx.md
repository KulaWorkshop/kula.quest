# mksfx

A command-line utility for modifying SFX files from Kula Quest.

## Overview

Kula Quest uses a custom binary format known as [**.SFX**](/formats/sfx) for storing sound effects used in gameplay.
There is only one of these files on a disc, and **mksfx** can extract its contents as **WAV** files, as well as build them from a configuration file.

## Installation

The latest pre-compiled binaries are available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/KulaWorkshop/mksfx/releases/).

## Usage

To extract an SFX file, use the **extract** command followed by its path and an output directory:

```bash
$ mksfx extract "HIRO.SFX" "output"
```

This will extract the sound files from the SFX file into a directory, and will also save a **yaml configuration** file in the directory:

```yaml
sounds:
- filename: sound001.wav
  pitch_value: 6400
- filename: sound002.wav
  pitch_value: 3328
- filename: sound003.wav
  pitch_value: 3328
- filename: sound004.wav
  pitch_value: 6400
- filename: sound005.wav
  pitch_value: 8704
  ...
```

You can make any adjustments to the config file or audio files as you'd like, just **be sure** that you encode your custom WAV files properly and that you update the pitch value if needed (See the [FFmpeg](#ffmpeg) section for more information).

To create an SFX file, use the **build** command followed by the path to create it and the path to a config file:

```bash
$ mksfx build "CUSTOM.SFX" "output/build.yaml"
```

::: tip Important

**Note**: Make sure that your sound files are in the same directory as the config file.

:::

If you would like to extract the sounds as raw **SPU-ADPCM** files, you can use the `--format raw` flag:

```bash
$ mksfx extract "HIRO.SFX" "output" --format raw
```

When importing a raw sound, be sure to set `format: raw` in the config file for that sound:

```yaml
- filename: sound010.raw
  format: raw
  pitch_value: 7936
```

## FFmpeg

To import a custom sound file, it must be prepared in the correct format.
[FFmpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg) is a popular tool used for converting audio files, and can be downloaded [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) for your platform.
Only the `ffmpeg` executable is needed for this process.

The following command will encode an audio file, in this case a `coin.mp3` file as an example, into the required format for mksfx â€” a **mono** (1 audio channel) **signed 16-bit PCM WAV** file:

```bash
$ ffmpeg -i "coin.mp3" -ac 1 -ar 22050 -sample_fmt s16 "output_coin.wav"
```

This command will also set the sample rate to **22050hz**, so when importing this sound be sure to set the pitch value to **6040**.
Here is a table with some common sample rates and their associated pitch value:

| Sample Rate | Pitch Value |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 11681hz     | 3328        |
| 22050hz     | 6040        |
| 23363hz     | 6400        |
| 33042hz     | 7936        |
| 39287hz     | 8704        |
| 44100hz     | 9216        |

In most cases, just using the example FFmpeg command above with a pitch value of 6040 will be sufficient for custom sounds.
