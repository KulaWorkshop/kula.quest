## Previous Versions

In the **alpha** release of the game, only sounds up to the **sunglasses collection** were present.
However, the bounce pill sound effect used to sound completely different:

<audio src="./original-bounce-pill.wav" controls />

In the **beta** release of the game, only sounds up to the **hourglass tick** were present, and the capture pod used to also have a completely different sound effect:

<audio src="./original-capture-pod.wav" controls />

It's unknown if these original sound effects were intended to be used for the bounce pill and capture pod as they go unused, it's just an assumption as they're placed in the same slots as the final version.

## Japanese Demos

In the following Japanese Kula Quest demos, the SFX file is sightly different. The level completion 100% sound is swapped with the non-100% completion sound, and the non-100% completion sound was changed to a completely new sound:
