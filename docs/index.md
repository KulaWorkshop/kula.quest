# Introduction

Welcome! This website contains documentation derived from countless hours of reverse engineering and research into the PlayStation 1 game **Kula Quest**.

![](/images/render.png)

Throughout this wiki, the game will be referred to as **Kula Quest** as it was the original name and was intended to be known as such all over the world [^1], despite most people knowing it as Kula World.
The other titles will be used in cases of version differences as needed.

::: warning Warning
This wiki is still under constant development, so expect a lot of changes!

## Gameplay

Kula Quest is a 3D puzzle-platformer video game developed by [Game Design Sweden AB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbabyworld) and released for the original PlayStation in 1998.
Published by [Sony Computer Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment) in Europe (_Kula World_) and Japan (_Kula Quest_), and by [Psygnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psygnosis) in North America (_Roll Away_), it casts players as a colorful beach ball navigating through a series of suspended structures filled with collectables and hazards.
The game's core mechanic revolves around **direction gravity**, which changes based on the ball's position, challenging players to think spatially.

## Resources

Several resources are available here, including:

- Tutorials for various tools for modding the game.
- Details for [every known release](/content/releases) and version differences.
- Technical documentation for most of Kula Quest's custom binary [formats](/formats).
