Here is a separate table for all the known demos containing the official [Kula World Trailer](https://youtu.be/XPKme7NelHQ):

| Product Code | Name                              | Region |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ------ |
| `SCED-00781` | Euro Demo 18 (France)             | PAL    |

For an unknown reason, multiple PlayStation game lists contain a "Kula World Beta" entry with the product code `BABD-3775`.
It is unknown if this version even exists or its origin, as `BABD` is not a standard product code convention for PlayStation games.

## Common Build Versions

Build version dates were determined by using the **latest date** inside the game files for the main release or demo.
The executable date and PVD timestamps are usually inaccurate, so this method was chosen.

### Alpha <Badge type="info" text="1997-08-04" />

![Screenshot of the title screen](/images/title-alpha.png)

| World | Levels           |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| Hiro  | 4 (1 unlockable) |

This is the earliest known build of the game released, when the game was originally intended to be called **Kula Quest** worldwide.
It contains 4 levels, with the last one being unlocked when all 3 fruits are collected.

There are 2 fruits that unused in this demo:

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
  <img src="/images/fruit-unknown.png" alt="Unused unknown fruit" width="100%" />
  <img src="/images/fruit-pumpkin.png" alt="Unused pumpkin fruit" width="100%" />
</div>

As well as 4 unused balls:

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
  <img src="/images/ball-1.png" alt="Unused ball 1" width="100%" />
  <img src="/images/ball-2.png" alt="Unused ball 2" width="100%" />
  <img src="/images/ball-3.png" alt="Unused ball 3" width="100%" />
  <img src="/images/ball-4.png" alt="Unused ball 4" width="100%" />
</div>

Several unused pieces of text go unused inside the game's executable, including references to world names not found in official releases of the game:

```
KULA, SUNSET, MARS, HIRO, FIELD, ICE, WOOD
```

What likely used to be the main menu options at some point:

```
1P GAME
2P GAME
LOAD GAME
OPTIONS
COMBAT
COOPERATIVE
BACK
```

Various level ending texts, including a somewhat ominous message telling the players that they "cheated":

```
YOU WERE\nFRIED!\n
\nGOT YOU!\n
\nACID DEATH!\n
\n\nYOU CHEATED!\n
```

A reference to a TIM image inside an EARTH directory, likely a startup warning screen:

```
\\EARTH\\WARNING.TIM;1
```

### Beta <Badge type="info" text="1998-01-30" />

![Screenshot of the title screen](/images/title-beta.png)

| World | Levels | Bonus Levels |
| ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| Hiro  | 3      | 1            |

This is the second known build of the game released, where it was renamed to **Kula World**.
It contains 3 regular levels and 1 bonus level. Several balls go unused, and can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NybEGYafcK8).

An unused fruit bowl is included in this demo, setting all of the fruit to collected when touched by the player.
This item is actually [inside the base games](https://x.com/SaturnKai1/status/1297644867288367104) as well, though the model is set to an hourglass instead.

![Unused fruit bowl](/images/fruit-bowl.png)

There are 5 unused present collectables, which have no sound effect or particles and just disappear when touched by the player.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
  <img src="/images/present-purple.png" alt="Unused purple present" width="100%" />
  <img src="/images/present-red.png" alt="Unused red present" width="100%" />
  <img src="/images/present-yellow.png" alt="Unused yellow present" width="100%" />
  <img src="/images/present-blue.png" alt="Unused blue present" width="100%" />
  <img src="/images/present-green.png" alt="Unused green present" width="100%" />
</div>

The unused "hedgehog" enemy in the main versions have an entirely different model in this demo, and some other models have slight differences as well.
A full video with a more in depth look at some of these model changes is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YokLTYeL65E).

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
  <img src="/images/early-enemy-danger.png" alt="Early unused enemy danger" width="100%" />
  <img src="/images/early-enemy-safe.png" alt="Early unused enemy safe" width="100%" />
  <img src="/images/early-captivator.png" alt="Early captivator" width="100%" />

  <img src="/images/early-arrow.png" alt="Early arrow" width="100%" />
</div>

There are a few unused cheat references:

```
"OBJ CHEAT\n"
"BONUS CHEAT\n"
```

There are also several unused .XA files referenced as well:

```
\\SAMPLE.XA;1
\\XA\\NIGHT.XA;1
\\XA\\EARTH.XA;1
\\XA\\SUNSET.XA;1
\\XA\\MUSIC_1.XA;1
\\XA\\MUSIC_3.XA;1
\\XA\\MUSIC_2.XA;1
```

### Beta (Inca Variant) <Badge type="info" text="1998-02-16" />

![Screenshot of the title screen](/images/title-beta-inca.png)

| World | Levels | Bonus Levels |
| ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| Inca  | 3      | 1            |

This build is mostly identical to the regular beta build.
It instead takes place in the **Inca** environment, has a different bonus level, and a slightly different executable file.

An interesting oddity is that the developers forget to change the sun glare to reflect on the new Inca skybox, which has the sun on the right side instead of behind.
Thus, this demo does not contain sun glare:

![Screenshot of the sun glare not appearing](/images/sun-glare-oddity.png)

## Unique Build Versions

### Kula World Prototype (Europe) <Badge type="tip" text="SCES-01000" />

![Front of the disc](https://files.hiddenpalace.org/8/85/PSX_-_Kula_World_6-16.jpeg)

This build is pretty obscure, with not much information known about its origin.
The build appears to have been made after the official release of Kula World, and is likely a copy sent to Psygnosis for review before publishing Roll Away.

It's pretty much identical to Kula World, with the following differences:

- Freecam is available without needing a code by pressing the **O** button.
- The introduction image was changed from `WARNING.TIM` to `SCEI.TIM` that displays "Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. Presents".
- The fruit placed by mistake inside the first Hills final level was removed.
- The executable file is slightly different from Kula World.

The `HIRO.GGI` file is slightly different, with the ball jump animation being updated to the version used in Roll Away, where the player can now jump and hit their head on certain blocks:

<video width="600" autoplay loop>
	<source src="/videos/comparison-kula-world.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
	Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<video width="600" autoplay loop>
	<source src="/videos/comparison-kula-world-prototype.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
	Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Some of the HUD sprites are slightly squished in height for an unknown reason as well:

- The fruit collection indicators
- Hourglass
- Key
- Kula World logo

### Play-Pre Vol. 16 (Japan) (Disc 1) <Badge type="tip" text="PCPX-96142" />

![Screenshot of the title screen](/images/title-PCPX-96142.png)

| World | Levels | Bonus Levels |
| ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| Hiro  | 5      | 1            |

### Kula Quest Taikenban (Japan) <Badge type="tip" text="PCPX-96121" />

![Screenshot of the title screen](/images/title-PCPX-96121.png)

| World   | Levels | Bonus Levels | Hidden Levels |
| ------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| Hiro    | 5      | 1            | -             |
| Inca    | 5      | 1            | -             |
| Haze    | 5      | 1            | 1             |
| CopyCat | 3      | -            | -             |

The level filenames inside the [PAK](/formats/pak) files in this version are all over the place in their order:

```
HIRO.PAK:
LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2, LEVEL 5, LEVEL 4, LEVEL 3, BONUS 1

INCA.PAK:
LEVEL 6, LEVEL 8, LEVEL 11, LEVEL 9, LEVEL 12, BONUS 2

HAZE.PAK:
LEVEL 7, LEVEL 10, LEVEL 13, LEVEL 14, LEVEL 15, BONUS 3, HIDDEN
```

### Famitsu Wave 6gatsu-gou Vol. 11 (Japan) <Badge type="tip" text="SLPM-80423" />

![Screenshot of the title screen](/images/title-SLPM-80423.png)

| World | Levels | Bonus Levels |
| ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| Inca  | 10     | 2            |

For an unknown reason, this disc contains an unused `KULA.SFX` file that is identical to the `TAIKEN1.SFX` file, and an unused `KULA.TGI` file that is identical to other demo **Haze** theme files (SCED-01850).

### Euro Demo 30 (France) <Badge type="tip" text="SCED-01850" />

![Screenshot of the title screen](/images/title-SCED-01850.png)

| World | Levels | Bonus Levels |
| ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| Haze  | 5      | 1            |
| Hills | 5      | 1            |

This is the only demo with the **Kula World** title that contains any reworked themes.
This disc contains a reworked Haze theme, while also containing a second pre-worked Hills theme with the original bonus titles, named `LULA.TGI`.
It also contains an unused `WARNING.TIM` file identical to official releases of Kula World.
Allows for turn delay to be toggled.

### Dengeki PlayStation D19 (Japan) <Badge type="tip" text="SLPM-80425" />

![Screenshot of the title screen](/images/title-SLPM-80425.png)

| World | Levels | Bonus Levels |
| ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| Haze  | 10     | 2            |

Level 7 contains a [level flag property](/formats/level#level-flag-property) that the game is not programmed to ignore in the final completion percentage, despite the executable being dated after the final Kula Quest release.
Subsequently, this causes the level to never show a **100%** completion, as the game thinks there's an additional item to be collected.

Additionally, for some reason the Haze soundtrack used in this demo is a version shorted to **2 minutes and 40 seconds**, as oppose to being **5 minutes and 9 seconds**.

### Hyper PlayStation Re-mix 1999 No. 6 <Badge type="tip" text="SLPM-80424" />

![Screenshot of the title screen](/images/title-SLPM-80424.png)

| World | Levels | Bonus Levels |
| ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| Haze  | 10     | 2            |

### Hyper PlayStation Re-mix 1999 No. 9 (Japan) (Disc 2) (Sony Computer Entertainment Special) <Badge type="tip" text="PCPX-96170" />

![Screenshot of the title screen](/images/title-PCPX-96170.png)

| World | Levels | Bonus Levels | Hidden Levels |
| ----- | ------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| Mars  | 5      | 1            | 1             |

The only known version of the game to contain the unused "**hedgehog**" enemy in a level.
This demo also includes the infamous **Sunset** level seen in the official trailer, with slight modifications to increase difficulty.

## Additional Oddities

The following oddities are from a [common build version](#common-build-versions) but are specific to the demo disc itself.

### Euro Demo 13 (Germany) <Badge type="info" text="SCED-00678" />

This demo contains a `TEST.CTI` file, which is a **CD Track Information** file used to define the structure of a PlayStation CD image.
This file is **not** supposed to be included inside a published game and was added by mistake.

```

### Euro Demo 10-01 (Germany) <Badge type="info" text="SCED-03473" />

The music is bugged in this demo and is completely silent, despite the game files being identical to other discs containing the same version.
Additionally, the demo itself titles the game as "Kula World" instead of Kula Quest like it should.

### Demo One (Version 6) (Europe) <Badge type="info" text="PBPX-95007" />

For an unknown reason, the second level is incorrectly displayed on the title screen, despite the game files being identical to other discs containing the same version.
